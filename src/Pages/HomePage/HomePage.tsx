        Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead the one crawling with
        vulture droids. I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. Oddball, do you

        I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple. That's why I went
        looking for Yoda. Have we had any contact from the temple? Received a
        coded retreat message we have. It requests all Jedi to return to the
        temple. It says the war is over.

        You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives,
        he will take care of you. We're receiving a message from the
        chancellor's office, sir. Send it through. Yes, sir. Senator Organa, the
        supreme chancellor requests your presence, at a special session of
        Congress.

        Leave us. You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they
        haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. I'm not sure I
        understand. You must sense what I have come to suspect.
